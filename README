Simple puppet module to install the Go toolchain (or several versions of it)

See manifests/init.pp for the list of parameters you can pass to the resource.

So far, the only installation method supported is downloading a tarball from an
HTTP mirror (by default the official one on googlecode.com). Adding more
methods (eg. from the official PPA for Ubuntu) should be fairly easy.
The downloading of the tarball is done using curl, so you'll need curl installed
for this module to work.
